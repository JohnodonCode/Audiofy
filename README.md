# Audiofy
Open source Electron MP3 player


## Building the .exe
1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `electron-builder`
This will create a `dist` folder with a setup file

## Usage
After the first time you open the app, you will have to set up a music folder. To do this, open the settings window by clicking on the gear in the corner of the screen. Where it says Music Directory, click Choose folder. Once you select a directory with MP3s (or other file types, I have only tested MP3s), click Save Settings and the window will refresh.
